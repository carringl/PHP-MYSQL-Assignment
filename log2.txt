comments- stressed out, worked all day, still cant get this completed. Dont understand the problem.

Final comments- Once again I am putting a time limit on this project. I still dont understand the components to make this run and I am making the conscious decision to learn the material rather than google my way through the code. I honestly think I will learn more this way, even though its not reflected in my grade.
